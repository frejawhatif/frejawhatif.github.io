	<h2>Chapter One: Achilles</h2>
	<div class="storytext">
	<h3>April 12, 2482</h3>
	
	<p>“Why not stay in the Navy? You’d certainly have more luck getting around in their fancy ships than that shithole,” Louie motioned towards Ylena’s small, run down vessel. He wasn’t wrong, it was a shithole. But it was her shithole, and she had bought it for dirt cheap so she couldn’t really complain. Louie continued his ramble about ‘back in my day’ this and that, while Ylena half-listened and sipped her drink. The smell from whatever was being used to fuel the campfire made it hard to enjoy, but she counted it as part of the fun. 
		
		<p>It had been just over a month since she left the Sol Pact Navy to become a traveling medic. She saw firsthand how devastating the Kiyan war had been to the rim, and decided that her talents would be better used on the field than a medbay. Some criticized her, expressing that she was throwing away her years of training.

		<p>Jokes on them I’ve used more of my training here already than in my six years of service. She took another sip of her whiskey. 
		
		<p>“And I tell you, the way Pandora would’ve done circles around those Kiyan ships like you’ve never seen!” Louie was still rambling. His scruffy gray hair was waving back and forth with every wild gesture. It was funny how deeply his appearance contrasted with the naval rank patch on his shoulder. Louie had followed a similar route to Ylena, albeit much later in life. He had joined the Navy when he was 22. Climbed the ranks all the way to captain. He told her his first mission as captain showed him all he needed to see about how little the government cared about the rim worlds, and he resigned that same evening. Ylena had heard every boast and brag in the book from Louie, but something told her that that story wasn’t an exaggeration.
		
		<p>She downed the last bit of her drink and stood up, “I think it’s time for me to head in for the night, Louie.”
		
		<p>“Ah, just here to steal my whiskey are ya?” Louie’s overgrown beard revealed a smirk.
		
		<p>“You know it,” Ylena yawned and placed her cup on the wooden crate beside her, then made her way back to her tent. 
		
		<p>The Kiyan had attacked Lich 3, known as Achilles by the locals, back when she was still in the Navy. In fact, this planet was the final nail in the coffin of her career. After the Kiyan were pushed back there was nothing left of the government. Anarchy broke out. A group of ex-law enforcement personnel rose to power, hoarding supplies and raiding villages. Ylena had to learn quickly how to work with limited resources, nothing like what she was used to on the Condor. The days were demanding and she was exhausted by the time she hit her bunk, but deep down she loved her new life.
</p>



	<h3>May 24, 2482</h3>
<p>
	Ylena was cleaning up in her medical tent after stitching up a patient’s thigh. She silently listed all of the supplies she was running out of while she ran her hands under the cold sink. Gauze, alcohol pads, syringes, painkillers. At least we have clean water, she thought. 
	
	<p>Suddenly a loud crack sounded off in the distance. Ylena turned off the water. Another. Gunshots. She dried her hands on her white coat and grabbed her medic bag as she rushed outside. Now she could hear screams and more gunshots. Could it be a raid? She looked around at the families emerging from their tents, frozen from panic, unsure where to go. They had already lost their homes to a previous raid, but the devils wouldn’t stop until they had everything. 
	
	<p>Ylena grabbed a nearby group of refugees, “Spread out and tell everyone to leave now. Don’t take anything with you. Move to the caves in the West and send a scout in 10 hours back here to check if it’s safe. Go!” The boys scattered, and Ylena ran towards the sounds of gunfire.
	
	<p>The raiders had filled the area with thick smoke. Ylena removed a respirator from her bag and placed it over her nose and mouth. Her eyes began to burn as she moved further into the area. She kept close to the buildings, scanning for injured civilians.
	
	<p>Footsteps. Close. She backed up against a concrete wall in an alleyway and remained motionless. “Open up!” She heard one raider shout as another kicked in the door of a house behind the wall. Ylena could hear people inside, one of them sounded like a child. She tried frantically to think of some way she could intervene, but it was no use. They were heavily armed and armored, plus attacking one would just alert the others. She quietly hit the back of her head against the wall in frustration.
	
	<p>“Get down! Hands where I can see them!” Ylena could hear the muffled sound of shelves and boxes being thrown to the ground. “Food, where do you keep the food?” The raider’s voice lowered to a threatening tone, “Don’t make me use this thing.”
	
	<p>“Please, we don’t have anything,” she could just make out another, quieter voice, “Take me if you must, just don’t hurt them!”
	
	<p>“Why do you think we would want you?” The raider scoffed, “You’d just be another mouth we’d have to feed,” a loud bang echoed from inside the building. Ylena felt a pit in her stomach. She heard more footsteps, this time making their way out of the house. After she was sure they were gone she ducked under the railing and entered the house. 

	<p>She could see three figures through the haze. She was right, there was a child. The father had been shot in the abdomen and the mother was still screaming over him. Their daughter sat there quietly, obviously in shock. She couldn’t have been more than six years old. Ylena tapped the side of her glasses and pulled out her medical scanner. Vitals popped up in her vision. His blood pressure was spiking initially but she knew it would drop soon from the blood loss. Heart rate was high too. No exit wound. She cut his shirt around the wound with scissors.

	<p>“I need you to put pressure on him,” she demonstrated to the woman next to him, presumably his wife. The woman nodded, still sobbing, and placed her hands over the wound. Blood began to seep through her fingers. Ylena put on fresh gloves and opened her vial case. She was running low on almost everything. She administered an analgesic for pain, antibiotic to prevent infection, and hemostatic to reduce bleeding, then asked the wife to remove her hands so she could pack the wound. Ylena had been out of gauze for three days, and had to resort to sanitized strips of cloth. 

	<p>“I need to keep him warm, do you have any blankets?” The wife nodded and left to grab them. The man seemed less panicked now, and the bleeding had slowed, but Ylena still needed to come back later to transport him to her medical tent. She pulled out her map and began counting houses when she heard a small cough. It was the girl. The smoke was beginning to flow in from the open doorway and was irritating her lungs. Ylena took off her gloves and grabbed another respirator from her bag. “Hey,” she said gently, “this’ll help you stop coughing.” She placed the mask over the girl’s nose and mouth– it was so big it almost covered her entire face. Ylena rustled through the pockets of her cargo pants. “And this,” she pulled out a small toy, “is for you.” The girl held her hands out and Ylena placed it delicately in her palms, which were about half the size of Ylena’s. She kept toys and candy in her pockets to give to children when she saw them. It wasn’t fair they had to grow up in fear that their family would be hurt or taken away, but maybe she could give them some hope.
</p>


<h3>June 8, 2482</h3>

<p>It had been over a week of almost constant raids. Ylena was taking a well deserved nap in the medical tent when she was woken up by a familiar voice.
	<p>“Hey doc.” 
	
	<p>Ylena opened her eyes to see Louie standing in the doorway, “Oh, hey Louie.” She rubbed her eyes groggily and sat up, “Did you need something?” Every muscle in her body ached. She had been working in this tent almost nonstop since she landed, and it was starting to wear her down. Louie pulled a chair from the corner and sat in front of Ylena’s cot. He seemed solemn, which was rare for him. He usually spoke in a brash, sarcastic way but now his voice was low and quiet. He folded his hands together and sighed.

	<p>“Ylena, I’ve been doing this for three decades now. You’re fresh out the Naval womb, so to speak. I’ve seen planets like this one struggle through years or decades of political upheaval, and there’s a lot more for you on the rim than sitting in this tent.” 

	<p>Ylena looked concerned, “I’m not sure what you mean, Louie. Are you suggesting I leave?”

	<p>Louie sighed, “Look, I’m not telling you what to do with your life, but I highly doubt you left the Navy just so you could get stuck in a medbay again. You’re meant to be on the field, making tourniquets with nothing but a scarf and sticks. I’ve been living here with these people for years. They’re resilient and resourceful and they’ll have me. Go leave footprints in the mud on some other planet that needs you more.” Ylena had to think for a minute. If it hadn’t been Louie telling her this she might have been upset, but she knew what he said came from a place of love and concern for her future. Nevertheless it felt wrong to consider leaving when she had already invested so much into helping them. Her body felt like it was breaking down, but she felt it was a small sacrifice that was compared to the homes and lives of the inhabitants lost here. What had she given up except a good night’s sleep?

	<p>She looked pensively towards the door. The sun was beginning to set, and was sending streaks of light into the tent. Just beyond she could see a group of children playing in the grass, laughing and throwing stones like marbles. Louie is right, this planet will keep spinning with or without me. 

	<p>She turned back to Louie, who was messing with his watch, “But Louie, where would I go? I only started here because I saw Achilles on the Condor.”

	<p>Louie took his hands away from his watch and looked back up at Ylena with a smile, “I’m glad you asked.” He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a small leather notebook. It looked old, maybe as old as Louie. “This is a record of every planet I’ve visited,” he handed the book to Ylena, “including my time in the Navy.” Ylena flipped through the pages. The journal was filled with stories, lists, pressed plants, and sketches. When she reached the last filled page she saw a list of three planets: Syrma 3, Alcor 3, Alasia 6.

	<p>“What are these?” Ylena looked up from the journal briefly.

	<p>“My next stops, or rather they were before I decided to extend my stay,” Louie reached out and took the journal back. “And now,” he ripped out the page and handed it to Ylena, “They’re your next stops.” Ylena folded the page gently and ran her thumb across the old, yellowed paper. Louie slapped his hands on his knees and stood up, “Well ain’t that a load of bullshit.” There was the Louie she knew and loved, it seemed he couldn’t handle this much sentimentality at once. He began to kick the chair along the floor back to its corner.

	<p>Ylena chuckled, “Thank you, Louie, genuinely.” Ylena placed the paper in her medical jacket pocket.

	<p>He waved his hand dismissively, “Eh, not like I was gonna use it.” Before he left the tent he paused, “You’re a good kid, Ylena. Don’t let anyone take advantage of that.”

	<p>“Drinks tonight?” Ylena asked as she reclined back onto the cot.

	<p>“You read my mind,” Louie winked and walked out the door.
